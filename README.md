4-Bit Sequential Multiplier
This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a 4-Bit Sequential Multiplier, a digital circuit used to perform multiplication of two 4-bit binary numbers sequentially. The multiplier processes the inputs bit by bit, making it resource-efficient and suitable for hardware with limited resources.
Overview
The 4-Bit Sequential Multiplier is a digital circuit designed to multiply two 4-bit binary numbers. Unlike combinational multipliers, sequential multipliers perform multiplication iteratively over multiple clock cycles. This approach reduces hardware complexity and is ideal for systems where area and power are critical constraints.

Features
Multiplies two 4-bit binary numbers.
Sequential operation to reduce hardware complexity.
Supports reset functionality for initializing the multiplier.
Easily extendable to larger bit-width multiplications.
